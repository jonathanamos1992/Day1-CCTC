The file /home/bombadil/mbroken is a copy of an MBR from another machine.

Hash the first partition of the file using md5sum. The flag is the hash.

Solution:
dd if=/dev/vda of=first_partition_16bytes.img bs=1 skip=446 count=16
Explanation:
if=/dev/vda: This is the source, the disk device you're reading from (in your case, it's /dev/vda).
of=first_partition_16bytes.img: This specifies the output file where the data (the first 16 bytes of the first partition) will be saved.
bs=1: This sets the block size to 1 byte, meaning we're copying byte-by-byte.
skip=446: Skips the first 446 bytes. Since the partition starts at byte 446, this will start reading from there.
count=16: This tells dd to copy exactly 16 bytes, starting at byte 446.
Why bs=1?
Since you only need 16 bytes (a very small amount), using bs=1 (byte-by-byte) allows you to precisely copy only the 16 bytes you're interested in, without overcomplicating the process or reading excess data.

Identify the default run level on the SysV Init Linux machine.

Flag format: #
Solution:
The file /etc/inittab is a text file that contains Run Level entries as variables read by /etc/init



What is the last script to run when the command init 6 is executed?

Flag format: /absolute/path

NOTE: “Use the Minas_Tirith machine for this question.”

soultion: cat /etc/inittab

We know init 6 is reboot

ls -lisa /etc/rc6.d

we see 36958 0 lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   16 Oct 13  2021 K08reboot -> ../init.d/reboot

we know .. is back one level so the full path is /etc/rc6.d/init.d/reboot
