Process validity

ps -elf to see running processes

htop -more dynamic in layout to see real time running processes. Live capture.
-f5   tree
ctrl-z or ctrl-c to exit out of htop
-to move have to arrow key
-F2 to sort columns

top
-shift -v hierarchical view
-f add or remove items
-to move have to arrow key



/sbin/init
-spawns all user processes
PID of 1




[kthreadd]
-spwans all kernel processes
PID of 2

ps --ppid 2 -lf
Displays only kthreadd processes

zombie processes
-do not consume resources but have a PID

SystemV 
-uses service command

SystemD
-uses systemctk 

Cron
-Scheduled tasks

if system cronjob, located in /etc/crontab

if user
command 'crontab' command to create user cronjons
user cron jobs stored in /var/spool/cron/crontabs/

sudo lsof | tail -30
-list of file descriptors

ex. sudo lsof | grep init

File Descriptors

txt
mem
#r (read)
#w (write)
#u (read & write)

when you have running processes,find exe -> <file>

will tell you what actually binary being executed is


Identify the names of the orphan processes on the SysV system.

NOTE: Remember, orphan processes spawn and die periodically. Try monitoring the processes list with top or htop to find them.
Solution:
use htop to see dynamic processes, live processes running
use F2 and navigate to add PPID, esc to exit
Wait for processes to child items and delete itself, eaving child processes to be adopted by init
