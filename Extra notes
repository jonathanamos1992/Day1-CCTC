#count unique words in a file 

# Path to the file
$filePath = "C:\Path\To\Your\File.txt"

# Read the file content
$content = Get-Content $filePath -Raw

# Split content into words, ignoring punctuation and making all words lowercase
$words = $content -split '\W+' | ForEach-Object { $_.ToLower() } | Where-Object { $_ -ne "" }

# Get unique words
$uniqueWords = $words | Sort-Object -Unique

# Count unique words
$uniqueCount = $uniqueWords.Count

# Output the result
Write-Output "Number of unique words: $uniqueCount"
